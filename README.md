# Big Data Processing Example : Java MapReduce program over AWS EMR 

Developed a Java based MapReduce program over AWS EMR to perform below Tasks:

1. Count words by Lengths: 
   Length (1 to 4) : Short Words
   Length (5 to 7) : Medium Words
   Length (8 to 10) : Long Words
   Length (> 10) : Extra-Long Words

2. Count words by the first character:
   Count all the words that begin with the vowel.
   Count all the words that begin with the consonant.

3. Implement In-Mapper Combining in a wordcount program.
4. Implement Partitioner in a wordcount program (2 reducers one for short and medium words another for long and extra-long words).
